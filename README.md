## 🔺 Alpha-DSA

> **Java + DSA Roadmap** from 📘 Scratch to 💥 Advanced – covering **patterns, recursion, trees, graphs, DP**, and more. Designed with real-time coding platforms like **LeetCode**, **GFG**, and **InterviewBit** in mind.

---

### 🚀 Description

* 👨‍💻 **Best suited for MAANG/FAANG preparation** – master every essential DSA topic.
* 🏁 Ideal for **self-paced learners, college students**, and **job seekers**.
* 🧑‍🎓 **Beginner-friendly** – starts with flowcharts, loops, and arrays.
* 🔁 **Hands-on problem-solving** from top coding platforms.
* 💬 **Well-commented Java code** – understand the *why* behind every solution.
* 🧠 Covers both **theory + practical** — from data types to dynamic programming & segment trees.
* 🧩 Follows a structured, easy-to-follow progression — learn by building your confidence.
